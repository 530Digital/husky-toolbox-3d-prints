# Husky Toolbox 3D Prints

A collection of 3D printable components for the Husky toolbox line found at HomeDepot.

This is a personal project I started as a way to get my Husky toolboxes organized. I recently got a 3D printer so I decided to print an organization system for each of the models I own.

## Printable Components

### Grid

The grid system is made up of square sections to keep the boxes and other components from sliding around in the drawers. I'm attempting to keep the grid system universal to all Husky toolboxes.

### Boxes

Boxes are referred to by the number of grid sections they take up in width and depth. For example 2x1 would be a box 2 sections wide by 1 section deep.
