All product drawer dimensions are converted from inches to millimeters for 3D modeling and printing.

## Grid

The grid system is made up of square sections to keep the boxes and other components from sliding around in the drawers. I'm attempting to keep the grid system universal to all Husky toolboxes.

## Boxes

Boxes are referred to by the number of grid sections they take up in width and depth. For example 2x1 would be a box 2 sections wide by 1 section deep.
